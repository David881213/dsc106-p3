Our data is sourced from the 2022-23 NBA Player Stats: Totals, as documented on Basketball-Reference. This dataset encompasses comprehensive average statistics for all NBA players during the 2022-2023 season. Additionally, player images have been obtained from Basketball-Reference to provide a visual representation within our application. However, it should be noted that images for two of the players are not available in the dataset.
For visual encodings, we crafted an array of player portraits as the primary visual markers in our interface. These portraits serve are recognizable reference for users that connecting the data to the real individuals it represents and making the abstract numbers of tangible statistics.
Sliders for Stats are user-friendly interface interactive tools that allow users to define the range of statistics they're interested in. These sliders are visual metaphors for filters, with each movement translating to a narrowing or widening of the search criteria. Their immediate responsiveness provides a sense of control and exploration, as users can dynamically adjust their query parameters and see the effects in real-time.
Upon hovering over a player's image, additional information is revealed. This on-demand data pop-up enriches the viewer's exploration, providing a deeper dive into the player's performance metrics when the viewer seeks it.
The interaction of Click to Compare affords users the capability to actively select two players from the filtered results and contrast their statistics directly within the same interface. This direct manipulation of data points fosters a hands-on approach to data analysis and eliminates the need for navigating away from the comparison context.
The Comparing Player Stats feature presents a side-by-side statistical breakdown of two selected players. This comparison is color-coded: red for better than others, green for worse, and yellow corresponded the same. This color-coding provides an instant visual cue, aiding in rapid analysis and comparison.
This design was chosen over alternative visualizations, such as histograms, which, while effective for showcasing distributions, do not provide the direct, multi-dimensional query capabilities that the slider-based interface does. The histogram's use of bar colors and heights to represent the quantity of players within a points range was deemed less user-centric for this specific application, which prioritizes direct access to individual player stats. The ultimate design choice focuses on delivering specific information—identifying precisely which players meet the selected criteria—over a generalized data overview. This user-centric approach aims to create an interactive tool that not only informs but also engages users in an exploratory analysis of player performances, enhancing the user's ability to perform complex multi-stat queries in a straightforward and visually appealing interface.

After deciding on our dataset, the 2022-23 NBA Player Stats: Totals from Basketball-Reference, we embarked on an extensive brainstorming session to conceptualize the visualization we aimed to present. Initially, we resolved to create a distribution bar histogram for average scores, which would reveal the players within each interval when hovering over the bars. We even completed most of this task (a collaborative effort over approximately 7-8 hours). However, we were suddenly struck by a better idea: to construct a filter for player stats. This new approach allows to deliver a more comprehensive set of information and a more comprehensible visual representation. Following a thorough discussion, we decided to abandon the original histogram and start from scratch on the player stats filter.
Having settled on our new direction, one member took on the responsibility of acquiring and organizing the data, as well as designing and fine-tuning the webpage, also supporting the other. Meanwhile, the other member worked on implementing the filter functionality and constructing the website. It took us five days to achieve the desired outcome, with most of our time dedicated to realizing the website's features. We explored various functions and versions, eventually creating an Interactive Visualization with all the anticipated features.
Nevertheless, we felt that merely displaying data was somewhat monotonous. Thus, we invested an entire day to integrate the player comparison feature into our website. This allowed viewers to choose two players for performance comparison after filtering the player list, culminating in what we consider our final product.
